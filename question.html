    # Thank you for taking the time to attempt the test :)

    ## Feature Request:
    Ebates.kr is looking to implement a new "Products" section that features products that were provided by our merchant, 옥션 (Auction). Auction will be providing us with a JSON feed and we are requested to digest the feed and display the products from the feed onto our page.

    ## Requirements:
    * A sample of products data is provided in products.json
    * A sample mock up of how the section should look like is provided in products.png
    * The products must be loaded in a carousel which displays:
        * 4 products on desktop/tablet devices, all 4 products should scroll together when the next arrow is clicked
        * 1 product on mobile devices
        * When hovered, the border and the cashback button should be highlighted (see the first product in products.png)
    * We should display any discounts in percentage, or 특별가 if there are no discounts
    * Text used:
        * 특별가 - Special
        * 원 - KRW (Korean Won Currency)
        * 캐시백 - Cash Back

    ## Additional:
    * We might be getting product feeds from more partners, design your app in such a way that it can take in additional_products.json as well (note that the format and information are different)
    * I18n Support - We might be replicating this feature for Ebates.sg, other than the name of the product, we have to use English

    ## Notes:
    * YOU DO NOT NEED TO IMPLEMENT ANY BACKEND SERVER, just use the json data (products.json) provided
    * You must load and make use of JQuery and Owl Carousel provided in the js folder
    * You must load style.css found in the css folder
    * You are encouraged to make use of other JavaScript or CSS frameworks that will help you accomplish the task (e.g. AngularJS, Bootstrap, etc.)
    * All JavaScript assets must be in the js folder, and all CSS assets must be in the css folder
    * All images must be in the img folder
