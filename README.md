# kappa-gooner.github.io

A simple carousel built using OwlCarousel and RequireJS

Some quick Notes:
1) The entry point can be found in main.js
2) The input JSON can be modified there (replace products.json with additional_products.json)
3) Also supports i18n localization: If you need an English version simply remove the locale override set in require's config (also in main.js)
4) On Mobile devices, you need to swipe to navigate (I opted not to use dots/nav arrows)
